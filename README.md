# Web Launchpad

Using Web Audio API + Web MIDI Api to sample using a Novation Launchpad.
Now you can be [Madeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTx3G6h2xyA)

I developed this demo for a talk that I gave at [Chilango Rails](http://chilangorails.com/)

## Get it running

* Connect your Launchpad to your machine
* Start a web server (`python -m SimpleHTTPServer` works)
* Go to the website

## ToDo

* [X] Light this baby up (turn on leds)
* [X] An interface maybe?
* [ ] Be able to record yourself sampling
